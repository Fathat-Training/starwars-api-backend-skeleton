<span style="color: #FF1B55FF">Go it alone - Exercise</span>


#### Description: 
This exercise is about Star Wars Characters and their introduction into our API. 

What we should be thinking about:

* The open API Specification for our character endpoints and their responses
* The character endpoints code
* The character data access layer
* The options for Characters - i.e. Selecting data we want to see - tip: similar to film options

Some information about Characters. 

* There are 83 Characters across the Star Wars movies. 
* Each individual Character record on the external Star Wars API can be retrieved by adding an ID to the url path just like with films

Hints: There should be two Character Endpoints.

Extras:

The Character endpoint for retrieving all Characters should allow the following two parameters to be passed with the endpoint call:

1. max_items - The total number of characters to retrieve
2. batch_size - The number of Characters to retrieve from a single request to the external Star Wars API.

Tip: The above two parameters are already handled in the Star Wars API code - check it out again
     You need to define them for the API specification and the endpoints and pass them along so that they
     reach the Star Wars API.

You have two days to figure this out - so let's get cracking.

##Good Luck and my the force be with you!
